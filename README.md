# Improving Robustness Against Stealthy Weight Bit-Flip Attacks by Output Code Matching

This is the code repository of the following [paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/papers/Ozdenizci_Improving_Robustness_Against_Stealthy_Weight_Bit-Flip_Attacks_by_Output_Code_CVPR_2022_paper.pdf) to train deep neural networks with output code matching (OCM) to improve robustness against stealthy adversarial weight bit-flip attacks.

"Improving Robustness Against Stealthy Weight Bit-Flip Attacks by Output Code Matching"\
<em>Ozan Ã–zdenizci, Robert Legenstein</em>\
IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022.

Currently the repository supports training the networks presented in the paper, and evaluating these networks with state-of-the-art [Stealthy T-BFA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12336.pdf) and [Stealthy TA-LBF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10496.pdf) attacks.

## Setup

You will need [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/) to run this code. You can simply start by executing:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install all dependencies and use the repository.

## Usage

You can use `main.py` to train and perform benign evaluations of quantized networks. Description of important arguments:

- `--dataset`: "CIFAR10", "CIFAR100", "ImageNet"
- `--arch`: "resnet20_quan", "resnet50_quan", "wrn28_4_quan", "wrn28_8_quan"
- `--bits`: quantization bits which is set to 8 or 4 in the paper
- `--ocm`: enable output code matching in the final layer of the model
- `--code_length`: length of the code bit strings for OCM (as a power of 2)
- `--output_act`: "linear", "tanh" (should be "tanh" for OCM models)

### End-to-end training with OCM & finetuning pre-trained vanilla models with OCM

- `ocm_train_cifar10.sh`: End-to-end training of ResNet-20 models on CIFAR-10 with OCM<sub>16</sub> and OCM<sub>64</sub>.
- `ocm_train_imagenet.sh` Training a vanilla ResNet-50 model on ImageNet and finetuning with OCM<sub>1024</sub>.

## Saved model weights

We share the OCM models trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet that are used for evaluations in the paper.
Different evaluations may naturally result in slight differences in the presented numbers.

* CIFAR-10 with ResNet-20 (8-bit): 
[OCM<sub>16</sub>](https://igi-web.tugraz.at/download/OzdenizciLegensteinCVPR2022/resnet20_quan8_OCM16.zip) | 
[OCM<sub>64</sub>](https://igi-web.tugraz.at/download/OzdenizciLegensteinCVPR2022/resnet20_quan8_OCM64.zip)
* ImageNet with ResNet-50 (8-bit):
[OCM<sub>1024</sub>](https://igi-web.tugraz.at/download/OzdenizciLegensteinCVPR2022/resnet50_quan8_OCM1024.zip) | 
[OCM<sub>2048</sub>](https://igi-web.tugraz.at/download/OzdenizciLegensteinCVPR2022/resnet50_quan8_OCM2048.zip)

### An example on how to evaluate saved model weights

To evaluate the ResNet-50 models with OCM<sub>1024</sub> against stealthy T-BFA:
```bash
python attack_tbfa.py --data_dir "data/" --dataset "ImageNet" -c 1000 --arch "resnet50_quan" --bits 8 --ocm --code_length 1024 --output_act "tanh" --outdir "results/imagenet/resnet50_quan8_OCM1024/"
```
